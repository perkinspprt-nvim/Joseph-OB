# NOTES.

1. **All That Remains.**
   - Super iconic Metalcore sound of the two thousands. Guitarist recently died (RIP). They got Jason Richardson on guitar now, they sound great and I really like Phil's vocals. The double bass is just *chef's kiss* and the bass tone is part of the iconic sound. It's a great band.

   - **Super Cool Characteristics** -
     1. Phil's Clean & Harsh Vocals.
     2. Metalcore Guitar lead tone.
     3. The sometimes rap-ey parts of the song (super sick!)
     4. DOUBLE BASS!!!!
  
   - **Songs of Note** - 
     1. Indictment (2006) - heavy cool riff, catchy.
     2. Divine (2024)- clean vocals, super hearty chorus.
     3. Let You Go (2024) - THE CHUG's !!! THE BREAKDOWN!!
