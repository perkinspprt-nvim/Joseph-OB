30-10-2023 - I will be starting my 1% better everyday challenge. for the week. 

Time for the one week variation.

Ok. How can I get 1% better everyday. I need to fix my sleep schedule. need to first get 7 hours of sleep. 

1. I will sleep for 7 hours a week.  I'll sleep at 10 and wake at 5:10 AM. 
2. I will exercise 4 times a week. Just need to do leg day consistently.
3. I will also meditate and aim to get 5 mins of meditation.

Now my Biggest peeve, the school work. I can't focus and finish my work. I work too slow and I end up sleeping at 11 every day. I just need to fix my school schedule. I have to do as much work as I can in class, then I can work on my sleep, exercise e.t.c.
