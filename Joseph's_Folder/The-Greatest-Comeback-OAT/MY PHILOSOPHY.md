I need to change my lifestyle. I have to take interest in life and all the things around me. I am going to start working tomorrow and I think that I have to become a qualitatively different person by the end of this summer. 

I have spoken to my father and he has imparted great wisdom to Me. I need to place more importance in my time and my decisions. TIME is my greatest resource and I WILL get returns where I invest it. 

I HAVE TO INVEST MY TIME RIGHT!
