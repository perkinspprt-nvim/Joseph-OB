Hi. I'm Joseph. Today is Wednesday, the 14th of February, It is 18:44 here in Uganda. I am having a bit of a Moment and I realise that I have way too Little passion. I'm going to embark on a new passion I hope to create. Just like I begun with Coding, I'm going to start with Math. (and it's Many cool cousins) 

### Welcome to Project; 'The Equation Of Greatness'.
I really Hope that I will be able to grow my love for math (and physics.) and become a smarter and greater individual By leading a calculated life. Here is how this Project is going to work. 

1. **Being True to myself**.
   None of this copy and paste BS because I don't want to get a bad grade, I need to start doing math. 
2. **Repetition**
   EVERY SINGLE DAY. I HAVE TO DO THAT MATH!

I just need to follow these simple rules. If I do that, I can make sure that I will be much better than I am right now. 

### Motto / Formula: *$\text{Focus} \times \text{Time} = \text{Results}$.

### Math resources : 
1. [Wolfram MathWorld.](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/HistoryandTerminology.html)
   Supposed to be a high Level/ advanced resource for Math. I still need to figure it out. 
2. [MathPlanet!](https://www.mathplanet.com)
   The Simpler version. I'm going to be visiting this one a lot more for now. cus im still a noob.
