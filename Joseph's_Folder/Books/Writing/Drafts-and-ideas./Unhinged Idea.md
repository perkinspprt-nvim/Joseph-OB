I want to write a web novel and maybe even possibly draw it out. Here is what I want so far. 

I want to make it dark and gritty and very interesting/unique. 
I want to have a very interesting MC. 
I want to have some pretty dark themes. 
I want to have a lot of references to the culture I consume(metal/African traditions/stuff-i-think-is-cool.)

I will sit on this idea for a while and then see where to take it. Hopefully, i have an unique idea for this Novel. 

- Gods' Legacy ? (A god has legacies that people can inherit as they are chosen.  )

IM GOING TO USE THE MINDMAPS!!!!!!
