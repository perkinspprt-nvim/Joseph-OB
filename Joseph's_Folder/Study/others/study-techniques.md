# Study techniques.   
This is where most of my study techniques will be collected as I learn to Study.

My solution (compilation)

â€‡â€‡5. Talk out if something is confusing.   
â€‡â€‡6. Sleep enough.

### *Essentials. ~ James Scholz*   
1. **QUALITY OF WORK** : $$ \text{Quality of Work} = \text{Focus} * \text{Time} $$
2. Aim for the **methods** to get the grades and not the grades themselves.   
3. **Rid the environment of distractions** and create a study space.    
4. Keep the body in **optimal study condition.**   
5. Set up a **reward system** to keep you motivated.   
6. Aim to progressively **get better at Studying.**

> Deep learning   
- Going deeper than what is on paper. Trying to connect and co-relate ideas to get deep understanding.   

> Learning Cycle   
- A cycle meant to be used to Study and learn how to use our brains and the information received.   

> Wide Study Scheduling   
- Choosing to study across 7 days is better than only 2 days before the test.
