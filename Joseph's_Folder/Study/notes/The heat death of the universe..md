Your task is to present a pitch outlining your idea for a short film (this will be presented in front of the whole class).

Your presentation will include a powerpoint and must include the following:
An outline of the story- start with a hook to build our curiosity and then show a storyboard with at least 6 scenes
Introduce your characters and casting- also explain what other roles you will need to cover- director, editors, cameraman etc.
Identify where you plan to shoot your scenes- in school/outside of school etc.
Explain the props or other special provisions that you will need to shoot this film (e.g. do you need to film after school one day?)
Finally, justify why you think this will be an engaging, successful short film (sell it to your group!!!)

You will have 4 minutes to present, followed by approximately 1 minute of question time about the finer details and logistics of your film.

## FILM PITCH #2
> Hell in high school.

WHO: Someone gets sent to Hell, devastated to find out it's high school.
DOES WHAT: Gets punished with cheerleading.
WHY: 
HOW DOES IT END: you don't make it out of hell. 

General Outline of the story: 

Character wakes up in the Middle of darkness and doesn't remember what they did.

Arrive in hell, turns out they died. 

Diablo gives gives the punishment of be part of the cheerleading team in a high school, as well as give them a chance to correct themselves by giving them a mission, to find who they killed and apologise. 

Big problem. everyone else is eery close to being human but they are not. If they find out your human, the eat you. 

Second big problem, they have no memory. they are looking for the other human in hell and that person is also doing their best to survive finding their killer (so they can hand them over to diablo. yeah, diablo is backstabbing them.) If they succeed in earning their forgiveness, they both return to life, if the victim succeeds in killing her murderer, they both suffer eternal damnation in the ninth circle damnation of Dante's inferno, "The land where light does not pass."
