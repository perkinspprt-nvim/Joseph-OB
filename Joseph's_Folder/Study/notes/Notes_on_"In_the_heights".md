From here, Just write A topic and then put some notes below it. 


### IN THE HEIGHTS 

##### What I noticed ? 
- Most of the community is black or carribian.
- The Story is being told through music.
- Lots of spansish language spread through out the culture. 
- Lots of stereotypes are used to reinforce the spanish culture. (chongas, lots of dancing and singing, salons e.t.c)
* Usnavi was named after a ship that his dad instead of reading *U.S Navy*, He read it as one word and that is how we got our main character.
* Usnavy's little dream is to go back to the Dominican Republic and resurrect his dad's business. It is in a pretty bad shape though. 
* Everyone seems to be having a hard time making ends meet. Usnavy runs a little store.
* Nina came back from stanford and is considering dropping out because of the expensive tution. 
* The Caribean was used to grow sugarcane thus mentioning the slaves and genocides. The slavers brought all kinds people explaining all kinds of race. 

##### Song/Scene Analysis
How do the following techniques reflect Carribean culture/the experiences of minorities in America?
- Song Lyrics and music style
- Camera Shots/Angles
- Mise en scene- costumes, props, setting
- Language
- Choreography
  
You should be able to write 3-6 sentences for each technique- maximum of 5 points awarded per technique response (graded as a percentage).
###### 96,000- the Pool scene
1. Amazing.
2. The music is extrmely upbeat as they keep switching scenes.
3. The Lyrics are about what people would do and how they would fulfill there "suenitos" (dreams.)
4. Mise en scene huh ? well the scene is in a pool but there is only people of hispanic or black descent. The choreography is enegetic and raw showing ethnic traits. 
5. The Camera angles are unbelievable, There are underwater shots to capture all the glory underwater (how do they even do that ?). The overshots capture all the glory overwater. The closeups to capture and put attention on the singers and their expression. 
6. Spanish is used but not as much as other songs. I think that English is used more because of the topic, Money. Money is mainly an American issue so it alludes to it more to speak english. The Latino community is more about the unity so Spanish is used to show connection.
