### Equalibrium Price and Quantity 
1. Equalibrium is the state in which market suplly and demand balance each other. As a result, the price becomes stable.
2. Generally, An over-supply of goods or services causes the prices to go down. This results in higher demand.
3. The under-supply of goods/services causes the prices to inturn go up and cause lower demand.
4. Where the consumer demand and produce supply cross is where the Equalibrium is found.
5. A market in equilibrium demonstrates three characteristics: the beahavior of agents is consistent there are no incentives for agents to change behaviour, and a dynamic process governs equilibrium outcomes. 
6. There are several different kinds of equalibriums in economics. 
7. In reality, the prices are never at true equilibrium, the proces just tend to go towards it.
