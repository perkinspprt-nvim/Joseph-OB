## Rewatching Caleb / Analysis:
> Just going to capture some of the points in terms of Lighting that observe while watching CALEB.

- First scene has a fade and the fade helps transition into the scene. The Eye level and Focus are on Caleb and the father is out of focus. A sense of comfort is present as the lighting is warm. 
- Long shot is used to get a ful view of their home. They lighting is soft and warm and helps paint the image of a home. 
- Focus is used to manipulate focus of the camera on Caleb to sharpen the feeling of no attention being on Caleb from the Parents.
- Tracking Caleb Across the room to meet his mother. 
- The chaos of the scene is enhanced by how much the camera focuses on the parents and Caleb juming between the parents. 
- Closeups on Caleb'a face also show his emotions and facial expressions to enhance chaos.
- there is a mid-long shot to capture the impact of the scene.
- The lighting is also reducing and the shadows are increasing to show the passage of time and the change in mood as Caleb' mood worsens. 
- The light is panning from low lighting (darkness) to the inside of the Play Area of Caleb and his clone. This Contrast shows they are hiding. 
- The Focus goes from a closeup of dad to a long shot onto the boys as they decide what to do. The great amounts of light show that the secret is out. 
- The MidShot captures all the relationships at once when there are sitting at One table. 
- Low angle is used on the kids because of the slight authority shift being shown as the boys have slightly outsmarted their parents.
