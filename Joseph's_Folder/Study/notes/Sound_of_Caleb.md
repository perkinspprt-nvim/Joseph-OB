From here, Just write A topic and then put some notes below it. 


### Sound Analysis of Caleb (Homework)
1. The Video opens with a voice over/off-screen dialogue (Caleb speaks while not on screen)
2. There were several soundtracks.
3. The first soundtrack was a bit eerie (piano). quite soft and mellow. 
4. There is a lot of Diegetic sound since the sound is comming from the movie scene itself. It is natural sound. 
5. Asychronus sound. Dad was not able to be heard and the audio wasn't matching what we were seeing.
6. The sound track returns and the parent's voices do get muffled. This is an example of Non-diegetic sound. 
7. The Music that Plays while the Boys are playing is really up beat. ( the drummer is playing a high.) it is also non-diegetic because the boys were playing a song with a speaker. 
8. synchronus sound was there wehen he was calling his parents. 
9. Voice-over (monologue) is shown when Dad is reading a letter from the clone family.
10.
