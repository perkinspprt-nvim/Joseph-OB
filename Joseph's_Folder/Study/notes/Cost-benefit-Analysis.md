#### COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS

- A Cost Benefit Analysis is a systematic way process that businesses use to analyze which decisions to make and which to forgo. The cost-benefit analyst sums up the total profit(rewards) expected from a deal or situation and subrtracts the costs. 
- Ofcourse this does Not only apply to tanglibe goods and can be placed on services, and other factors like the benefits of where you live. 
- Formula : $$CostBenefit = \text{Sum of profit} - \text{Sum of Costs}$$
- Cost Benefit Analysis also involves some other metrics (things to be accounted) such as :
	- Income (revenue earned)
	- Costs saved because of a purchase
	  
	  Some more complex Analysis might include Intangible metrics like :
	- Employee morale
	- Customer satisfaction

At the end of it. An Analysis that results in more benefits/profit is generally favourable for a company or business body to undertake.
