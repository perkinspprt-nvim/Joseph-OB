# Just Focus

Sub (link): [[Physics]]


What do you plan to do today ?: Going to do distance and see where it takes me.

From here, Just write A topic and then put some notes below it. 

## DISTANCE

- Distance is defined as the magnitude of motion.
- Distance is measured in terms of length covered by an object during motion. The initial and final positions are two very important points used when describing distance but they do not determine distance. distance can often be non-linear making the distance between the initial and final non-linear as-well. This means we can't always get the right distance by just taking a straight path from one point to another. 
- Distance is a scalar value. This means that distance will always increase independent of direction of motion. A long as an object moves, the distance covered will increase. This also means that distance can never be negative.
- The standard symbol for distance is "s" but the units can be measured in metres, kilometres, miles e.t.c


## POSITION

- The position of a particle is a point in the defined volumetric space of the coordinate systems. 
- Coordinate systems enable us to specify a point in a defined volumetric space. Objects however, are not points since they have volume and that are approximated in a "point-like" manner to describe their translational motion. The cartesian system is used to define the position of a point by assigning it a x,y,z value. These points are of course relative to a ORIGIN. 
- x, y and z values are directional thus they can be negative.
