### TEST REVIEW. 

#### Scarcity 
1. Defined as the main economic problem of Limited resources amongst Unlimited wants. 
2. Natural elements such as air can be considered scarce because they come at a "cost" of what we have to do for the air to remain clean and usable. 
3. Scarcity can also show how expensive/costly a Good's factors of production are. of course, some products cost so Much to make that the output is also scarce. 
4. How can society deal with scarcity ? We either increase supply or reduce demand. By increasing the **supply** and reducing the **demand** The more accessible goods and services become, The less scarce they will be. Of course, their will be limiting factors such as land and protection capacity so you will still find some sort of threshold/limit.
