### Marginal Utility (self study)

1. Marginal Analysis how business decide on choices.
2. Utility is the Happiness that people get from good services and goods. 
3. The law of diminishing marginal utility says that the more something is consumed, the less desirable it is. 
4. You might not be willing to pay full price for the third ride. The seller gets this and figures it might be better to charge them less for the third ride. That's why we have deals like buy-to and get the third half off. The point is, we all use marginal analysis when we make decisions. Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, that's marginal analysis. Barn with our new knowledge, let's go back and look at the most important model of microeconomics, supply and demand on the runway. Let's use the market for strawberries. The price of strawberries is on vertical axis, a quantity on the horizontal axis. The demand curve for strawberries is down with sloping, showing a lot of demand. When prices are high, people don't want to buy very many. When prices are low, people want to buy a lot. The shape of the demand curve reflects the idea of a lot of diminishing marginal utility. The first pint of strawberries you buy gives you a lot of additional utility. The second one, maybe not as much. The third pint, even less. You have to be 10 pints, you're going to get sick. So, as you consume more, you're willing to pay less and less. This explains why the demand curve is down with sloping, and why it's really just a marginal benefit curve. The supply curve is upward sloping, representing no loss of plot. An increase in price gives producers an incentive to produce more. It turns out that supply curves are really just marginal cost curves. It represents the additional amount of resources, time, and energy that each additional pint of strawberries costs. cars this graphic.
5. If gas stations had sales in sewers, would you buy that much more gas? Economists would say that the demand for gasoline was relatively inelastic. A large percent change in the price leads to a small percent change in the quantity demanded. This is shown on the graph by making the demand curve steeper. Other products that have relatively inelastic demand include electricity, cold air, and coffee. There's no substitute for my five cups of coffee in the morning. And there are few products that have perfectly inelastic demand. If the price goes up, people who cannot afford it will fully buy the same amount. An example is insulin or diabetics. Because in that case, they need it to live. What about the demand for pizza? Well, there are many closed subsidies. I need a burrito or a burger. I really need pizza. So if the price can cause the demand to decrease a lot, the demand curve would be in more flat. If the price is going to decrease, the demand for pizza is relatively elastic. If a pizza place has a sale, a lot of customers would buy a pizza instead of other substitutes, like burgers and burritos. Now, there's also elasticity of supply. A steep curve shows the supply is relatively inelastic. So a large price is now in the point where an airplane is difficult in times of a build. So even if the buyer wants a more inelastic, they're still going to have to go. So the deal after supply is when the one that is sensitive is not expensive. So the price is now inelastic. So the buyer is going to have more inelastic.
