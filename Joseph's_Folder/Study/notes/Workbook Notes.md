What do you plan to do today ?: 
Just going to do some work book notes.

From here, Just write A topic and then put some notes below it. 

 ### Workbook Notes 

1.  On Force vs Displacement graph, The area under the liine is equal to work done. This is because Force(f) x displacement($\delta d$).
2. When Work is equal to the the change in mechanical energy, then $W_{net} = \delta K$. This is important because if we have the the Work done and the Mass, we can use the formula of Kinetic energy which is $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$.
3. Work is measured in Newton metres or Joules. 
4. THe law of conservation of Energy state that Energy can neither created nor destroyed, it just transfers from one form to another. 
5. In systems which are closed, Energy is not lost to external factors and forces.
6. The formula for work can also be written as $W_{net} = F\cos \theta \times displacement(\delta d)$. This is important as not all ground will be 180 degrees. In those cases,  The angle of elevation of the ground can be plugged in giving the actual amount of Work being done.
