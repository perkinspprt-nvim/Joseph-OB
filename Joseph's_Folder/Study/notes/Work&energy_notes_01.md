# Just Focus

Sub (link): [[Physics]]

What do you plan to do today ?: 
Going to Note some of the stuff I have learned while starting UNIT 4; Work and Energy.

### TOPICS : 
* Work and Energy

From here, Just write A topic and then put some notes below it. 


## Work and Energy
1. Work is defined as Force applied over a dispalcement (W = F x displacement)
2. W = F cos $\theta$ when considering work accross the x axis where x = cos $\theta$. 
3. Energy is the ability to get work done. When work is done, the energy of a system has changed. Work is the change in energy of a system due to an external force.
4. Forms of Energy include Chemical Energy (Nuclear, Food, etc) whee chemical reactions convert energy. Mechanical Energy which is simple the sum of the Potential and Kinetic energy of a system. Thermal Energy (heat) and some others.
5. The formula for kinetic energy is $KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$ while the One for potential energy is m(mass) X g(ravity) x h(eight) or $PE = m \times g \times h$
6. Power is defined as Work over time. The formula is $P = \frac{F \times \delta x}{\delta t}$ and the power is Inversly proportional to time thus the less time the work is done, the more power there is.
