### Factor Markets, Product Markets and More


From here, Just write A topic and then put some notes below it. 

Factor Market : All the resources that businesses use to rent purchase or hire in order to produce goods  or services. 

Those needs are F.O.Ps (Factors of production) listed here:
1. Capital
2. labour
3. Land
4. Raw materials

Product Market: Where final goods or services are sold to a private homes ? 

In a factor market, the producer has to look at the FOPs and see how to make them into good's or services, in a product market, it's about what the final person is receiving, The End result. The producer is more worried about what the buyer gets. 

The Product Market looks at **How much they gain and how much they loose**

In the Product market, firms are **sellers**, whereas in the factor marker, firms are buyers.

The Demand of any resource is derived from the products that can be produced from the resources.

The Demand for a resource is downwards because the MPP ( Marginal Physical Product.) is also reducing for each input. This results in the law of diminishing marginal returns. 

The Firm will continue to hire more **factors** as Long as the MRP (Marginal Revenue Product) exceeds the Marginal resource cost. This simply means that as long as the Revenue is higher than the cost of resources, they will continue to add more inputs/factors. 

The firm will maximise profit when $\text{MRP} = \text{MRC}$. (Where the Profit is equal to the cost of resources.)

Monopsony : These are the one's that dominate the factors of production. This is kind of like hiding their sources and don't want the other firms to have access to their FOP's. Ex. CocaCola's secret formula. 


### Circular Flow. 

The buyer - seller situation is reversed in this situation. The *households* become the suppliers of factors while the *firms* become the buyers of the factors necessary for production. 

Firms demand <u>Inputs</u> in markets that are *perfectly competitive*. This means that the Prices (wages, interest, rent) are determined by the industry and taken the firm. They can also be *monosopnistic*, meaning that their is only one buyer of the FOPs and they seek to buy at the most profitable price. 


#### Small exercise (on the markets.)
