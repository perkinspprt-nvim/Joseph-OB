# Just Focus

Sub (link): [[Physics]] 

What do you plan to do today ?: 
I plan to do some work On physics and also want to do some work in Physics. There is a ton of stuff I have been postponing.

### TOPICS : 
* 4.2 Skill 7.2 
* 4.3 Skill 6.4

From here, Just write A topic and then put some notes below it. 

### Work and Mechanical energy (4.2 Skill 7.2)
1. Work is Force applied over distance.  If the force and displacement (both vector quantites) are acting the same direction, The Amount of work is equal to the product of the magnitude of force and displacement. 
   $Work = \text{Force} \times \text{Displacement}$. 
   
2. When the force is not exactly applied at the same angle as the displacment, I need to use the $\cos()$ function that I learned in trogonemtry since $\cos() = x$ according to trigonometry. This allows us to input the angle at which work was done and then just work from there. 
3. The Amount of Workdone is equal to the componnent of the force that is working in the same direction as displacement. Theta($\theta$) is used to specify the angleof the compontent of the Force.

### Work and Mechanical Energy (4.2 SKill 6.4)
1. Energy is the ability to do work. When work is done, there is a change in Energy. 
2. The word *energy* orignates from the greek word "energeia"  which means activity. This was somewhere around the 4th century.
3. Some of the major forms of Energy.
	- Thermal (heat)
	- Chemical 
	- Nuclear
	- Electirical
	- Radiant
	- Sound 
	- Light
	- **Kinetic**
	- **Elastic Potential** 
	- **Gravitational Potential**
	  *The ones in bold are the ones that will majorly be focused in AP Physics 1*
4. Some of the major Energy forms.
	1. Kinetic Energy is the energy due to the <u>Motion</u> of an object. 
	2. Potential Energy is the energy due to the <u>Position</u> of an object.
	3. Gravitational Potential Energy is the energy due to the position of an object and how gravity affects it from that position. 
	4. Elastic Potential Energy is the Energy from the stretched positon of an Elastic material.
