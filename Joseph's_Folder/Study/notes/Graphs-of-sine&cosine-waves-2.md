From here, Just write A topic and then put some notes below it. 

#### Getting Ready for the Test. 
- Hey, Just taking some small notes on what I noticed while doing the worksheet. 
- I need to be really careful with units and Drawing the Graphs.
- The negative sign that Flips the graph is elusive so I have to watch out for it.
- Also do not forget the signs of the D and C. I seem to forget those the most. 
- I also need to include the $\pi$ symbol when using radians and the theta($\theta$) when working on  

Can't take the most elusive notes today because of time constraints but yeah, that's it.
