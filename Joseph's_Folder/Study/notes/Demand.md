### Demand 
- Demand is the relationship between the price and how much someone wants to buy it.
- The law of Demand states that The higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded while The lower the price, the higher the quantity demanded.
- In terms of other certain demand and stuff like this so a change in quantity of demand is only affected by a change in the price and that means you are only moving along that same demand curve but whenever there is a change in demand that means there will be a change in the inwards shift of the demand curve or an outwards shift of the demand curve then at some point I am coming to you with the right we will look at individual demands and the amount of demand I will raise you with some other expressions before I turn to you please see my right so a change in demand is like immediately two products and then change in quantity demanded is in that same product I am going to accept that I am going to accept it but I want you to explain it in case I am going to accept it.
- There are complimentary goods where if one increases, the other will increase because they go hand in hand. (toothpaste and toothbrush, bread and butter. )
- There are susbsitute goods where you will subsitute to another incase of chnage in price. (pepsi and cocacola, Coffee and Tea)
