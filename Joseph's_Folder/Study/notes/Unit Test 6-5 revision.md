What do you plan to do today ?: 

Notes On what I did why revising for Precalc

---
### TOPICS : 
* Domain Range and Period
* Trigonometric Function Graphs
* Writing Equations for Trig graphs
* Solving Trigonometric Equations.

From here, Just write A topic and then put some notes below it. 

### Unit Test Revision 

##### Domain Range and Period 
1. Sine ;  D: (-$\infty, \infty$).  Range; [1, -1]. P; 2$\pi$
2.  Cosecant ;  D: All reals $x \neq n \pi$,  Range; $(-\infty,-1]U[1,\infty)$ . P; 2$\pi$
   
3.  Cosine ;  D: (-$\infty, \infty$).  Range; [1, -1]. P; 2$\pi$
4.  Cosecant ;  D: All reals $x \neq \frac{\pi}{2}+n \pi$,  Range; $(-\infty,-1]U[1,\infty)$ . P; 2$\pi$

6. Tangent ;  D: All reals $x \neq \frac{\pi}{2}+n \pi$ , Range; $(-\infty,\infty)$ .  P; $\pi$
7. Tangent ;  D: All reals $x \neq n \pi$ , Range; $(-\infty,\infty)$ .  P; $\pi$


#### Trigonometric Function graphs(Common mistakes)

1. Always remember to check if Radian(x) or degrees($\theta$)
2. Make sure to factor out the number from the equation inorder to the correct B and C Value.
3. Cotangent is slightyly built different. It acts alot more like the sine and cosine while looking like sine and cosine.
4. NEGATIVE SIGNS. These are pretty important. make sure to include them in your graphs since they flip the graph. 


#### Writing Graph equations.

1. Period : Read it like a scalar value, Don't care about the signs because the distance is just getting translated but not transformed. 
2. Make sure to start by looking for the Mid-line; It makes everything Significantly easier. 


#### Solving Trigonometric Functions.
1. Remember the domains of the functions. Sine and Tangent can only exist on the right side while cosine, Only on the top half. 
2. Substitution makes things simpler ~Carl 
3. In the situation that both the function and it's inverse get an angle that is in the same quadrant for thr both of them. We just cancel them. In the case of $\sin(sin^{-1}(\frac{4}{9}))$ will just be equal to $\frac{4}{9}$ since the sine and it's inverse will just cancel. 
4. In the case when the fraction over goes the border of an inverse function $tan^{-1}\left( tan\left( \frac{3\pi}{5} \right) \right)$. It will be translated to the negative side using a straight line and the angle's remainder will switch to negative.
5. The $cos^{-1} 0$ is basically found by plotting the unit circle and looking where the $x$ is equal to 0. The same is done for $sine^{-1} 0$ by looking for where y = 0. Then, for both of them, you consider the Domains of the functions and then write the answer to which is in the domain.
6. Never have a root on the bottom.
7. You can use pythagoras theorem, just use it responsibly. 
8. If the angle is greatly bigger than one revolution. Count the revolutions it makes and make sure to get a remainder. If the remainder is in area where another function cannot exist, use the striaght line translation trick.
