What do you plan to do today ?: 
Did 6.1 day 1 and day 2. It was about graphing the sine and cosine waves.

From here, Just write A topic and then put some notes below it. 

## Graphs of the Sine and Cosine Functions. #EASY-DIFF

- The sine and cosine functions are examples of periodic functions. Periodic functions are functions that repeat values over a period/ have regular intervals.
- The Period of a function is the distance of one complete cycle. In other words, it is the distance between when each cycle repeats. The sine and cosine functions have a period of 2 pi. So every two pi, the cycle of repeating intervals restarts. 
- Amplitude is the distance between the midpoint and the highest point of the function. For the basic y = sin (x), the amplitude is one. The same goes for cosine. 
- The sine graph is odd and starts from 0, where as the cosine graph starts from the amplitude and is even.
- Phase shift : the amount of horizontal displacement from the functions original position. 
- The equations often come as y = A sin B and b can either be a radian or degree value. The A dictates the amplitude, you just have to get the absolute value. Then the B gets divided by 4 in-order to turn it into a critical point, when you have all the critical points, you put the simplified versions on the x axis and you use your knowledge of the sine and cosine functions and how they look to draw the graph. the sign of the A value determines whether the function is flipped or not. 
- This is what the formula looks like when broken down to it's different parts :$$
f(x)= A\sin(x + C)+D
  $$
