> Graphs of Tan, Cosecant, Secant and Cotangent

# Just Focus

Sub (link): [[Precalculus]]

What do you plan to do today ?: 
Just Noting down some stuff I relaised while doing my precalc homework. Tangent were real wild cards.

From here, Just write A topic and then put some notes below it. 

### Graphs of Tan, Sec, Csc and Cot.

1. These are mostly the inverse functions except Tangent which was not included In the first lessons of Sine and Cosine because of it's Oddball behaviour. 
2. Cosecant(sine^-1) and Secant(cosine^-1) both have graphs that will display parabolas on top of the peaks(curves) where the graph reaches full amplitude. The points where the graphs cross the x axis will act as asymptotes to define the shape of the parabola.
3. It is useful to first draw the un-inversed function and draw it's inverse based on newly aquired skills when drawing the csc and sec. 
4. Tangent is very muc of an outlier and is made of several asymptotes making it look like a recurring bunch of segmented graphs. it is also has a period of just $\pi$ and this it hasthree points where one of them goes through the origin (0, 0). 
5. Cotangent is similar to tangent but it has a reversed facing Points and it doesn't cross the origin when $f(x) = \cot(\theta \text{ or } \pi )$. It also has a period of $\pi$ and also looks like a recurring bunch of graphs due to it's asymptotes. 
6. It helps that when your critical point value doesn't match your period's denominator to just factor it since it will make finding the points easier. 
7. When finding tan $\text{CP's}$, it is good to find two values ahead and two values back from your starting point which is dictated by $\text{C}$ in the formula, $f(x) = A \tan (Bx + C) + D$. 
8. When it comes to doing the reverse and you are given some sort of graph, always remember to put the $\theta$ or the $x$ when writing the equations. please remmeber; *tangent only has a period of $\pi$. if you forget, it will mess you up when finding the B value.
