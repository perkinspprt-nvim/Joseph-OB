# Just Focus

Sub (link): [[Physics]]

What do you plan to do today ?: *Today, I want to do Three topics on coordinate systems and More I have been very behind on my personal studies and I need to make some progress towards doing better.*

### TOPICS : 
* Coordinate systems
* Distance
*

From here, Just write A topic and then put some notes below it. 

## Coordinate systems.
- Rectangular/ Cartesian : These ones are the ones most used since it conveniently describes 3d motion in the x,y,z axis linearly. 
- Spherical : A point is placed on a sphere and can be described in motion of theta, and a circle with a line going through it. and radius which starts from an origin point. 
- Cylindrical: A point is placed on a cylinder. the graphing is mostly of a circle using theta for angles but the z(depth) axis is mainly just the depth that stretches the cylinder.  

Okay, this is going well. next we have Distance
