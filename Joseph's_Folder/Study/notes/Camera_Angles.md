## Camera Angles & Shots

1. Eye level : what your eyes would see if you were in the film. (realism and normal)
2. High angle : The camera is high and the subject is down (to make the characters look powerless & small.)
3. Overshot(bird's eye) : Really high up.( To show the world and surroundings. )
4. Low angle : Camera is lower than subject (opposite of high angle)
5. Undershot: Camera underneath the subject. (makes things look Massive.)
6. Mid shot : Shows character from waist up 
7. Extreme close-ups : Really close (to emphasise a characters features. )
8. Close-up : Not as close as a extreme one (normally the character's face.)
9. Extreme long-shot : Really long shots (good for sci-fi and fantasy because they paint a really vast believable image.)

## Camera Movements

Crane shot : Attach a Camera to a crane. (angles down and swing.)
Tracking shot : A move shot on a dolly (a cart with wheels.) that tracks a subject.
Pan : Pan shots stand in one place and they slowly move on the x axis.
Swish pan : GOTTA GO FAST!
Tilt : stays in one place and swivels vertically.
