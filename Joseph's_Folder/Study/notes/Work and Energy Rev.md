REVIEWED PHYSICS UNIT : WORK AND ENERGY

---

## Work and energy. 

Work(W) is defined as a **change** in Energy(E). $$\delta E = W = F_{net} distance = Fd\cos\theta$$
$F\_{parallel} = F \cos \theta$. This is refers to how forces are applied at **angles**. Important because a perpendicular force does **not** do any work. 

There are **three** kinds of mechanical energy stored. Kinetic(KE), Potential($U \_{g}$)and Spring($U \_{s}$).

Kinetic Energy = $\frac{1}{2} m v\square$ *squared.* Kinetic energy cannot be negative as Mass can never be negative. Velocity is squared and thus can **never** end as a negative.

Spring Potential Energy = $\frac{1}{2} k x\square$. Also cannot be negative for similar reasons. This kind of energy is found in **all** elastic materials. The $x$ stands for the displacement from the spring's **equilibrium**. The equilibrium is where the spring settles as it has **no** Forces acting on it. 

Gravitational Potential Energy = m g h / $mg\delta y$. 'g' is the gravitational acceleration. 'h' stands for distance from the ground. It *can* be *negative* since it all depends on where your horizontal zero/ ground is. If the mass is somehow below it, you have negative potential energy. The delta Y is used more for when there is a initial and final height. 


-> CONSERVATION OF MECHANICAL ENERGY
$$ MechanicalEnergy_{initial} = MechanicalEnergy_{final}$$
WHEN : We use the law of conservation of energy when there are *no non-conservative forces*(forces that take energy away from the system.) acting on the mass. These include Friction, Air resistance e.t.c

HOW: First specify where you will start (initial) and your final. Identify the Mechanical Energy that is present. Calculate using formulas.

QN: What do we do when there is a non-conservative force acting on the mass ? 
We use the *work equation* and remember how Work = Change in Energy. If we have either the initial or the Final energy, we can then plugin the values for the non-conservative force and then. 


-> POWER !!!
$$P = \frac{\delta E}{\delta t} = \frac{W}{\delta t} = F v\cos \theta$$
This is essentially how *long* it takes to *do work/ change the energy* in a system. 
P is measured in watts which are just joules per sec. *BTW 756 watts = 1 Hurspurs(Horse power!!!)*. irrelevant but revolutionary. 


-> HOOKE'S LAW
$$F_{spring} = k x$$ $X$ is *directly* proportional to the force. If we draw a graph of force vs time and got the slope, it would be K, the spring constant.
