## IT'S THE END OF THE WEEEEEKK!!!

It's the End of the Week. Let's so some weekly reflection. 

This week has been good. I made big leaps in terms of productivity and I am building some steady momentum in what I want to achieve for the future. I am still debating between CS and C.Engineering. I am going to keep working on just progressing in my code and eventually get to where I want to be.

I am going to change who I am. I need to start becoming what I want to be, i need to take steps on the road to the city. I need to start disconnecting with unimportant individuals. 

I want to learn new skills Like the guitar, public speaking, low singing, the drums, how to study, how to become a math pro. I don't have time for all the unimportant individuals in my life.

The Next week, I will progress towards being a more purposeful individual.
