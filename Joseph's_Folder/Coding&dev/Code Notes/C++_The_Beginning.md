Hey. it's me Joseph. It is 17:50 on Sunday 25th, 2024. 

I decided to Pick up C++ because it is a low-level language.
Why is this important ?
- Ultra fast -- Good for games.
- Ultra fast -- Good for systems, this is in relation to Computer Engineering.

I will be writing and noting a few things here. not totally everything. That approach has not worked. 

#### 25/02/2024--@Joseph: Note.
1. Since I am using the Terminal (like a pro), I should Use g++. If I don't, it will default to clang (utter garbage). 
2. If want like a debuggable version. I need to add the `-ggdb` flag at the end of the running command. EXAMPLE: `g++ HelloWorld.cpp -o run --ggdb`.
