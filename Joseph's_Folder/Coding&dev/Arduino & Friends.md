Alright Let's get to it. 

## FREECODECAMP Arduino & Electronics. 

#### 1. BREADBOARDS

- Big ol pieces of plastic with a bunch of holes all over them that have wires running through them. 

- The two sections in the middle have horizontally running wires while the last two on each end have a long horizontal one and are used for power. 

NEGATIVE(-) / GROUND --> black
POSITIVE(+) --> Red

#### 2. RESISTORS

- An electric component used to limit current. Current always flows from positive to negative.
- They do the important job of stopping electrical components from by resisting current. 
- Is calculated with
