# Code </>   
I want to learn python, C, C++, Javascript and so many other coding languages. I've got less than two years(August 2023).  

(*@Joseph~16/02/2024)
Okay, I'm going to do a revamp of a lot of these. I have realised just how ineffective these are. I need to actually think about what I want to be as a developer.

I don't think that I'm really suited for web design and all that, However, for Now I will do it because it's really practical and fun. it also leads to me learning about backend, which I think would be exquisite. 

However for Now, I think that I'd like to be a **Embedded system's engineer**

This means That I need to start also look into being an embedded systems engineer is all about.
