JUST DO THE THING

Gonna work on some physics. I need to try and be strict with my reading times in order to not get bored and to control my generation's short form brain rot problem. I need to work and reward myself equally. Let's work on some physics. 

Let's do some Unit review with flipping physics. Right down some digital notes (it's been a while.) Then practice FRQ's and MCQ's. 

I am lagging on precalc because I do not have my calculator. 

Done watching the review vid. Going to take some short notes after i go for shower.
