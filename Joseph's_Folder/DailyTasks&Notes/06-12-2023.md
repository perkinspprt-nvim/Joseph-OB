Just Talking to Myself : 

This is the week I need to be the most organised but I seem to be skipping My tasks and being Unable to do work. i feel shit and I am to blame. I should have done all my work yesterday. I have to push and finish the work. Today, I will not hoop or anything. I have to focus and lock in, I have already wasted 2 days of my week. 

Joseph. leave your primal self behind and gain greater conscience. You must not let your body control itself. The streetcar called desire shouldn't drive itself, It needs a driver. It need "you". GO OUT AND TAKE CONTROL OF YOURSELF. 

Sadly, you don't have Internet so just look Into that CSS stuff. 

Tyler - fuzzy search the pdf for some quotes. 

I am convincing myself to do some actual work. I am a capable person, I just am not choosing to do the work I need to. 

LET'S GET TO IT.
