Good morning. 
I just had breakfast. I am here to declare some stuff you know. motivational brain dump.

I want to have an identity. 
I want to live up to the smart guy that everyone thinks I am. 
I'll even surpass him. 
I want to be...me. 
I have strong and found beliefs in being grateful for all my parents have done for me. 
I can't let them down.
I want to make it to college and do normal college things. 
I want to pass highly with my many high-value friends and I want to make my parents proud. 
My dad works year round not seeing his children for months on end just for us to go to school.
I want to be like my dad.
A strong and driven man. 
Yes, Driven. I want his drive and his work ethic. 
I can't be lesser than my father, look at how hard he worked in his terrible work conditions. 
I..have..to...succeed. 

!Done! 

Now let's plan for the day and ready up to do some deep work.
