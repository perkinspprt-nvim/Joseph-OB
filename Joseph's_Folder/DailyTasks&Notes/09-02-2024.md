Just Talking to Myself : 

17:17 :: Good Evening, School was difficult today, I saw how badly I did on my Precalc test and my Grade for Physics dropped to a C. I need to become extra vigilant and make sure that I stop failing my classes, i'll probably be able to raise my grade to a B if I do well on my next quiz. Hopefully, I can continue to do my co-curricular activities and make my parents proud. 

22:00 :: ... I havent gotten any work done for all these hours. I think Im not going to make it if I keep working at this pace. I cant keep lazing around pretending to be focusing and expecting results. Something needs to change or I'm not going to make it. Dear God, Help me to put my focus in the right places.
