: saw a cool post on using Anki to learn Guitar. 
I feel like i need to get my life more in structure. I have been gooning too much as of lately. I need to put it back on track. Today, I am going to complete what I can for my Summer 60 challenge while I actually learn something in relation to my project. I'll plan how to get to work tomorrow.

Anyway, tonight is for getting to work. 

Let's eat and get back on task.
