[[MY PHILOSOPHY]]

_Document Entry Here_ : [[1% better everyday documentation]]

OK, this is the 1% better everyday challenge and I think that the sleep schedule is going to work but now I need to work and actually finish my work witin the time.

I kept procrastinating and now I have like 2 hours to do all he work. But i will grind it out. 

OKo, I m going to catalogue this before I sleep, I have managed to some big part of english and I will wake up tomorrow to annotate it. I have not fapped and I have tried working for long sections but I can say that it is going well.
