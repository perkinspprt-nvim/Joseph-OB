Just Talking to Myself : 

I am not well mentally. I see things and hear things but i feel uncertain I'm alive. I am trying to type without looking at my keyboard and I am finding It difficult. I also feel so stressed and unsure if I want to be alive at this moment.  

I am cold and I hate everything. I don't know what to do. I just want to hole up in a corner and learn emacs. I feel dead inside.
