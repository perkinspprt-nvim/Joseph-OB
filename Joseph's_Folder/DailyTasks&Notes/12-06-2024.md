Today, I was barely productive. I had the chance to do something great but I have been slacking greatly.I had the opportunity to do all the right things. BUT I DIDN'T. I should be more responsible with my time. I am not self driven enough. I indulge in pleasure to much. I am letting my brain lie to me. NO MORE LIES! STOP THE EXCUSES! DO SOMETHING! 

let's get to it.
