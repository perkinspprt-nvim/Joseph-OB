## FOLLOWING [[MY PHILOSOPHY]]. 

Something to say ?:

---

IMEI Crosschecker (Fake Phones)

- Using an API to fetch and cross check data. 
- API - interface for data communication. 

Front End - What you see/Interact with.

Backend - 
API to fetch the "user's" IMEI number
APIs to fetch IMEI number data.

- Since someone was able to pick someone else's IMEI and use it in a fake/duplicate phone. We can also use the IMEI's to search and pick the original vs the duplicate.
