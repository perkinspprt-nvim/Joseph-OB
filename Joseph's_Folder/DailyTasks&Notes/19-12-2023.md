Just Talking to Myself : 

Hey, I haven't journaled in a while. I just want to get my thoughts clear and decide what I'm going to to do. I have to pull the git repo because I was too lazy to push the git before, now my progress is gone. I need to figure out the problem with my Progression. i will then redo the two assignments and then I will be able to read the book I have become so enamoured with.
