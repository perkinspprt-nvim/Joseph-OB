Just Talking to Myself : Well hello, I 'd just like to start working on the odin project because coding doesn't feel like a hassle compared to all the others. Today, I have to complete the lab for physics an also do all the precalc HW that I have and haven't done. I need to stop being a lazy cunt and do some work. 

Here we go onto the Odin Project <10:15 am>
