Something to say ?: JUST DO THE THING.REST LATER.

---
Morning, 

I just woke up and read for a bit. I want to finish these FRQ's and move onto editing for film study. I need to get working. It's due today. Today, I need to put in more time into studying fro physics. I will present this morning. Grind precalc. Grind English. rest break. Grind Physics. Try and get my corrections done in Microeconomics. Eat lunch quick. Get to doing final edits and maybe the end credits and bloopers(I am smart, I need to use smart software like davinci.) Do a bit of GP and end the day resting and relaxing. DO NOT HOOP. Come home and study physics. rest and study more before you sleep. This is the plan for today, thought out in my head.
