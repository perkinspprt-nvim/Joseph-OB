Just Talking to Myself : 

Hey, I just came back home. Today we had the Duke of Edinburgh hike and It was pretty good. I was kinda sad about which group I got added to but I managed to carry a shit ton of weight and I ended up not feeling bad after we got to the site. People complemented me for my strength and It was the best feeling in the world. I have to start a more strict workout routine so that I can get even stronger. I want to be whole and swole. I want to have a shit ton of strength. I need to start making more strict schedules.
