Just Talking to Myself : 

Good Morning, it's a new day and I still have quite a ton of precalc HW. 
I am feeling great and time is just moving so slowly, perhaps I should have done some work. I don't feel too lazy i'll work for five minutes then go shower. 

I'm just going to optimise obsidian all the way till break time. I hope I can figure things out, let me work in linking up the files. I managed to organise a lot of hubs and make a button to open my daily journal thing. it feels nice to finally have some stuff optimised. 

I'll actually do some SAT english. I would like to not feel som empty and disappointed in myself. I am going to work on some SAT english and try to get some 10% before I can chill completely for the rest of the class. 

I did It, I got to 71, percent and Now I have to worry less about that. all I have left is english and precalc. I just need to do my best. 

Ughhhh, I procrastinated and didn't do my work.
