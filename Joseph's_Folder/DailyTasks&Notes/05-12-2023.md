Just Talking to Myself : Good morning bro. I just ran 2k when I came to school. I feel less shitty than I thought I would feel. I will work on trying to be able to run it without stopping and actually running with speed. I think that I need to increase my awareness.  

I have failed myself again by not doing the work I told myself I would do. I am disappointed in myself and I am not trying to put a system together so that I can live in peace.
