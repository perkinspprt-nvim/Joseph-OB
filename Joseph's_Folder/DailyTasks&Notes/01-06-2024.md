## FOLLOWING [[MY PHILOSOPHY]]. 

Something to say ?:

---

I need to have better moral drive and guidance. Daddy has advised me to work on my time keeping skills or else I am going to struggle in life. He is indeed right. I do have a lot of problems around procrastination and time.

I need to become more active in being a better person and doing better work. 

I procrastinated a bunch. I need to some arduino stuff before I sleep.
