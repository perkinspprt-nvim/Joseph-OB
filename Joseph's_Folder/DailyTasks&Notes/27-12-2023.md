Just Talking to Myself : 

hey, Ive been straying alot and Not studying. I will finish my coding assignment, read a bit and then after that do a ton of physics. I need to steel myself and remember who I am. I am Not a lazy unproductive copy of kevin. I am higher, more advanced. My future hold better potential.
