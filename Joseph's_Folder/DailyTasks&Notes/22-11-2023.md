Just Talking to Myself : 

Morning. I failed to do my precalc and I will sacrifice sleep for it.

Hey, I just watched some videos and I feel inspired. I have to write about this. 
I have a porn addiction and a weak mind. I have ignorantly been fulfilling my desires and I have been killing myself with dopamine overflow. The overflow of dopamine is killing me because it is causing me to find difficulty in less dopamine providing tasks like doing math. I have to stop before this gives me erectile dysfunction at 30. I will also try to get Jonathan to stop as well. Ok, I need to get to doing some math and other stuff. let me work for sometime on the physics and other stuff then hopefully, I can deep dive into the precalc rabbit whole


I have to sacrifice my sleep for precalc today. I must so that I don't suffer in future. 

Okay, I did a little precalc, not as much as I wanted to but it is a big improvement from yesterday, Im sleeping with regret but not a lot of it and I think that that is a step in the right direction. Just going to check my logs and add some stuff i want to do tomorrow.
