Hello, it's me. 

I have wasted most of my week and have not really made as many gains as I would have liked. That is all on me. I was not focused enough.

Let's correct that. I can't sit here and cry over spilt milk. I have to save myself. No one is coming to save me. 

let's focus. 


Done with Micron. Feeling great but it took me longer that it shouldve. 
Moving onto Writing and brain storming for abyssal tales. Probably for less than an hour and just move onto physics. Finished working on abyssal tales.
