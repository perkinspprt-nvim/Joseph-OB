Something to say ?:

Hello, 

I have wasted most of today and done some unimaginable things. I need to study for the upcoming exams in order to not get pants down. I pray that I have the actual strength to complete the work. 

Let me read and take evening tea, then embark on studying for precalc. After that, I can do some actual work. 

Let's go. I am going to keep procrastinating if i don't get to it.
