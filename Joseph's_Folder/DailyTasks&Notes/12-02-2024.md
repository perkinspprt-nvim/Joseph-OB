Just Talking to Myself : 

I just woke up today and wasted all my precalc time.  I need to maximize and focus on my assignment to make sure that I can do precalc at home.

Wasted a lot of time doing useless gobdagoo, I watched youtube shorts for almsot 2 hours and I have never felt so much hatred for myself. I'm going to try doing my 7.6 Homework for like an hour, I will then get to doing the worksheet. After that, I will aim to do physics and work on English in the morning when I wake up.

Don't sit there and cry, get to work.
