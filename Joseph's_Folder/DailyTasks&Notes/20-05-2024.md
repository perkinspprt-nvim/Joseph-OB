Something to say ?:

Hey. 

I finished AP physics believe it or not. I feel incredibly relieved. I have to lock in for Precalc. I have two tests tomorrow. 

It's GP and Ethics but I think I will be fine on both of them. I need to study for precalc however. I will do more Precalc right now and then, I will review some ethics before I sleep. I will wake up early to review more ethics and then hopefully finish the day strong by having more precalc review.
