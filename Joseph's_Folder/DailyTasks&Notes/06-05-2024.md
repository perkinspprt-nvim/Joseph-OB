Something to say ?:

Keep it simple, Student.
Just do the thing.

I'm going to just do the thing. I will study micro economics for 2 hrs and do a bunch of practice questions. I will do a bunch of theory review tomorrow when I wake up. Hopefully I can also do 10 questions of Unit 2 : Kinematics Physics review before I sleep.
MOVE!
