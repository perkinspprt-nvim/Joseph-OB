Just Talking to Myself : 

Good morning.

21:30 :: Sorry, Haven't Journaled all day. I have been busy. Did the precalc test and I feel like a weight was removed from my back. I just need to study a lot more and keep on track. I feel a bit focused right now as I finially managed to stop my procrastination dead in it's tracks and get some work done. Still down that I procrastinated so much but let's work towards getting better.
