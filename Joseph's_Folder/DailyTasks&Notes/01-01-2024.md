Just Talking to Myself :

Happy New years. I am starting my day super late but I need to embark on my assignments. I have a ton of things I didn't complete yesterday. 

Let's read a bit, Do the first physics topic. 

Read a bit more, do the second physics topic before leaving today. I will probable comeback home and do another topic then work on sunny's brilliant emporium.
