Good morning,
Yesterday started well and I managed to do some work, better than I usually do on any day where I'm free. 

But, It wasn't enough, I got distracted several times and I also postponed a ton of assignments today. Technically, the number of assignments I did was abysmal to say the least. Today, I'm going to strive to complete my goals. 

$Focus \times Time = Results$.

Hey. I have disappointed Myself once again. I have done very little work and I feel quite paralyzed. I have to get some work in before I sleep.
