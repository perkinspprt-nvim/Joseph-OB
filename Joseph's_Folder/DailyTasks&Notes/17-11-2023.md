Just Talking to Myself : 

Good morning. It's nice to see you again. I woke up today and procrastinated a little but now I am ready to code a little and do some work. 

I did my Precalculus games and I feel like I did great on it. I played a ton of basketball today and my legs hurt like crazy. 

Shit, my mom took me for a hair cut. I look pretty bad. I don't know what i am going to do.  I'm going to look like I cut my hair with my eyes closed while at school. I don't know what to do. I feel this pain rising within me and I am struggling to think straight and I am finding it difficult to get any work done. I will work on some programming because it doesn't make me feel like a worthless sad sack of shit.
