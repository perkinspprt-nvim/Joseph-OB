I've really been struggling to focus as of late. I'm going to have to step up my focus game. I have a bunch of work to do, A test to revise for but I wasted so many hours. I havent coded or done anything productive. matter of fact. I went to the bathroom and did some things is shouldn't have. 

I'm not proud of myself. I need to wake up. 
No one is coming to save me. 
Only I can save my self.
This is personal.
