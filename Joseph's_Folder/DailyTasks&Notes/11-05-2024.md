JUST DO THE THING!
----------------------------

I procrastinated a ton yesterday and felt rather shitty. I lost my calc, i lost my nofap streak of a few months. I'm kinda pissed with myself rn. 

I have to lock in.
Exams are around the corner. I will study for physics today. I also need to do my Precalc but I somehow lost my calculator yesterday morning. I need to find a way to find it. 

PHYICS : I will review MCQ's, FRQ's and then I'll end it by reviewing a unit. I will make a Unit highlight review and type the Notes here. 

PRECALC : I still need to lowkey find my calculator. If I can find it, that would be incredible. I will then do those precalc assignments that im behind in. 

CODING : Plan to code today, I have been feeling extremely drained in terms of tech and things like that, I need to indulge myself into some coding and making something. 

BOOKS : Setting up my book system and actually reading stuff.
