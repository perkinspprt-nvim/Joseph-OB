### Did I get it all done ? 
--- 
  *response (Y/N) : * No
  
*if so, CONGRATS! 
any thing you'd like to do better ? : 
  
*If not, DO BETTER, 
HOW CAN YOU DO BETTER ?  : *     

I will have to honestly, do the work. stop lying to myself that I am doing the work and then realising at the dead line that no work was actually done. I feel sick. sick to the core. I really hate how much if a procrastinator I can be sometimes.
