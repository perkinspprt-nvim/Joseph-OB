Just Talking to Myself : 

Hey,
I just let myself down. yesterday I had all this work I planned to do and I went to sleep before I even did 50% of it. I have to hustle today to complete it and also get some precalc revision in. 

The plan is 2 hours of physics. and hour to do SAT math and SAT english and then just jump onto precalculus. If I actually focus, I can do the work and also go ahead and get some coding in.

##### PHYSICS FOR TODAY
(TIME PLANNED : 2 Hours )
- [x] Unit one : assignment 1
- [x] Unit one : assignment 2
- [x] Unit two : assignment 1
- [x] Unit two : assignment 2
- [ ] Unit Three : assignment 1
- [ ] Unit three : assignment 2

Finished one assignment on unit one yesterday so, I'll embark on as second one as well and I hope to finish it soon. 

Also, I have been trying some physical notes but I haven't been incorporating it very well. I tried getting to business and I feel Like I just don't know what do with the notebook. 

I'll think about it later. 


I'm ashamed of myself, it is now one and I haven't even done a single spec of work. This is worse than i thought. I really need to fix my ability to do my work. 

Hey, I dossed a Ton and all the sudden it is time to sleep but I feel much better about the end of today. I want to wake up tomorrow and do some code. I'll do some precalc after it, then some physics and finally bible. 

Gn.
