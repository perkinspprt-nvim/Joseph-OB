Just Talking to Myself : 

Good Evening. I just did my precalc test and I don't feel too bad. I just have to revise the graph drawing Unit and make sure I ace tomorrow's test. This is going to be Lightweight. For physics, I need to get to page 136 but I need to understand the concepts rather than just trying to fill in the book. I should also go ahead and check AP classroom. 

PRECALC STUDY SESSION ! LET'S GOOOOO!!!!!!
