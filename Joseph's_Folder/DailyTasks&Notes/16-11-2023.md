Just Talking to Myself : I am descending into madness. I am becoming More lazy and less proactive. I have to focus. THIS IS MY LIFE. 

I finally finished my physics workbook. I feel less shit. I just want to collapse but I cant do that yet. Im gonna do my Coding. Haven't done that today. 

Ok, Today, I did my best and I almost managed to complete my task but I kept my Mind clear and I am going to sleep early.
