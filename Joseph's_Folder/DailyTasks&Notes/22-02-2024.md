GOoOOODDd Morniing,

Time to study. it is 5:09 in the morning. Studying for economics and doing some personal math research. 

I just studied some microecon. I feel great. A lot more prepared for the test. I'm gonna dress Up, get to school. DO my slides and some precalc and then passively study towards the test time. 

Oh Wow. i watched some stuff and I feel pretty interested in some things. 
Gotta get around to getting that video editing software. also need to take a lesson on filming. 

Right now, I need to study though. I will postpone all of that for studying. 
starting at 8:00pm, plan to sleep at around 11, wake up at 4:30 pm.

...
I did pretty shit. I couldn't study even one number. I am kinda hopeless.
I'll wake up early tomorrow to study. extra early.
