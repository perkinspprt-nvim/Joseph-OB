I have to focus today. I've skipped a bunch of Physics and precalc and I will struggle because of my bad descisions. I keep getting sucked deeper and deeper into a world of limited attention span. in these two days of being left alone. I have not studied as much as I would in a single school evening and it is all MY FAULT.
