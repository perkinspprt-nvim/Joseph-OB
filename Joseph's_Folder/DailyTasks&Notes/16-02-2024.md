Good Morning. It's Ten and I have goofed around all morning. Hopefully, I will be home alone today and hopefully God and the Good part of my conscious will overrule to day. 

I have a ton of tasks i didn't complete yesterday. i'll first finish them and then get on with today's tasks. Today, I plan to do a ton of precalc HW, some personal physics research and then end the day writing and coding. 

LET'S GOO ! $\text{Focus} \times \text{Time} = Results$

I have slacked for a few hours, I need to get back on track and actually do somework if I even plan to work On some personal projects by night time.
