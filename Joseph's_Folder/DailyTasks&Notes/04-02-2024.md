Just Talking to Myself : 

Good Morning. I am writing to improve my productivity. I need to think and also do my work but sadly, I have begun quite late. 

I am back late in the Night to complete my Journal and go to sleep. My mum just made me wash socks and many of my fingers feel liek they have wounds on them. I am unsure how to act at the Moment but hopeully the pain will go away soon. 

I think that today was a slightly above average day in terms of Productivity and I think I could have done better, like washing those socks earlier. I want to also get onto my workout once again and get bigger. I'd like to improve my physics study technique aswell and see how to get consistent A's in physics. 

Gotta head to sleep but hopefully I can continue to study and become a worthy individual unlike those hooligans with no future I saw at the gas station on the way to church today. No way I end up like them.

Good Night!
