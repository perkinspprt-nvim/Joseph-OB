JUST DO THE WORK!

---

Good evening. 

I am planning on starting my work assignments for today. 

I should have begun them today but unfortunately, I procrastinated. TBH, I am going to keep doing it if I keep telling myself dumb stuff like I'll do It later, I need to be proactive especially as I get ready to work. 

I have to write to my supervisor and get ready for work. I'll have to look into what is done at the Uganda Communications Commission in order to best understand how I can employ my skills. I'm pretty lucky that I've got one month. 

Let's get on the grind. I have to want it.
