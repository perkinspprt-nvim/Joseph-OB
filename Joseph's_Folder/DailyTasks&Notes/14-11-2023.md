Just Talking to Myself : 

Okay. Today, I'll start my journey. I felt too lazy to try and figure out my homework yesterday. and I feel shame. I'll try getting it done today if I can. Please God help me. 

16:43 : Today has been tiring. I went and played basketball and further destroyed mum's shoes. I don't feel proud at all. I am trying to convince myself to get some work done so that I can be less of a disappointment. 

18:32 : precalc with Ms carol was actually fairly good today.  I feel like I now understand the material and I will be able to go one here on out. This is great. I will just finish the rest of the worksheet and go take a nice cold shower(ultra sigma hard man lol). I don't feel so shit rn. 








### Did I get it all done ?
