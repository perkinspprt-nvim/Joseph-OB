Something to say ?:

JUST DO THE THING.

---

Morning! 

I have to achieve to achieve stuff. If, I do not, i would be perpetuating the things that are stopping me form achieving my goals. I gotta do my precalc, or else I will be left behind. I have already proved to myself that I'm pretty capable of doing work without having to be pushed. I just have to get working and get in the zone until i finish the assignments. I have to actively solve the problems or else I will end up passively wasting time. 

I have been mentally avoiding the topic of my books and how i use it to avoid doing work. My inner procrastinator has been kicking in lately and telling me that I am doing a much better thing than scrolling indefinitely on social like most of my doomed friends. It is but, at the end of the day, I am actively avoiding doing work by escaping to reading. I need to balance it. I will only read between breaks. It needs to be something i postpone for later as a reward for hard work in precalculus.
