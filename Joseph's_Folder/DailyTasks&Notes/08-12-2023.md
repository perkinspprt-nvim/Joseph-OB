Just Talking to Myself : 

Today has been a good day,  I finished the English exam and I feel like I did well. I just want to do some stuff and map my ideas in a notebook because I have been feeling quite lost.  I want to do a lot of physics review today, then finish 5% of Sat Math. do some SAT english and then finally touch on some precalculus review. I think that If  I manage to keep time, I can finish up with some precalc but If I don't I will primarily study it tomorrow. Sunday might be more physics review and more precalculus and a ton of ethics. 

I'll also try working on doing some physical notes. 
For physics, I'll try to do atleast like 2-3 assigments per unit to make sure I get more general info. more on Unit one and two 

##### PHYSICS FOR TODAY
(TIME PLANNED : 2 Hours )
- [x] Unit one : assignment 1
- [ ] Unit one : assignment 2
- [ ] Unit two : assignment 1
- [ ] Unit two : assignment 2
- [ ] Unit Three : assignment 1
- [ ] Unit three : assignment 2

I wasted My time but I finally convinced myself to start. it is 19:17 so around 9, I should be finishing up with the revision. then I'll work on the other stuff at 10. 

 I Just gotta focus. 
 ### FOCUS 

we have a problem. AP classroom's garbage website isnt loading so I have to do something else in these last 15 mins. I will work on some SAT math.
