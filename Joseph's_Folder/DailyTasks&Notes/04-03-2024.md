Good Morning. 
i want to get started working but I feel like sh. IDK why though. I'm just going to organize my thoughts to get out of this lazy haze. Let me study. 

alright. I have to start with fixing my grades. I will then ask for Mr Katumba's number ?

I will send an Email to Mr Katumba about the workbook situation. I will ask for a re opening of that one assignment. i will do the workbook and finish unit 4. No, I must first make sure I send an Email to Ms. Bridget about the powerschool situation. if I can fix these two, I will be able to work on my precalc, film study Pitch and some AP classroom physics.

Ok, I have a Plan for the day. Let me just Get some todo's into the app and then start working.


I Procrastinated like crazy. I need to go focus mode.

Let's get this physics done and work until we finish my other tasks. 

Nobody is coming to save you, you gotta save yourself.
