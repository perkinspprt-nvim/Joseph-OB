#### Tagging.
Tagging can be done both in the properties and  in the reference sheet just after the title. Remember to break stuff up using titles. Here are the more essential tags
1. If Important - tag it with **IMP**
2. if character related - tag it with **char**
3. if plot related - tag it with **plot**
4. if system related - tag it with **system**

These will be the pillars on Identifying how to check your references again.
