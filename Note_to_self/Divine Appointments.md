#### Notes üìù : 
- Christians are unable to discern what is wrong and right in the current world. Many people are missing God and it's so detrimental because they don't even know it. - We are the ones that are far from God. Not God from us. 
* God has given grace to the ignorant and many people are wasting it because they don't even know that they are under God's grace and actively   wasting it.
* *Sunesis* - wisdom (greek) :
	  The critical faculties that aligns people with purpose and away from danger.
* *Phronesis* - wisdom(greek) : 
	  The wisdom that aligns someone towards an end. Without an end in sight, leads people to places they are not meant to end. 
* Many times people do not change you, they only bring out a buried bad part of you. 
* We make offences that repel the divine appointments. We get envious, angry and commit an offence that makes us miss divine appointment. 
- We should make it a Point to celebrate others rather than crying about it or becoming angry about. 
- There are many parts of life where we can easily miss God but we need to understand that circumstances are meant to teach us and bring closer to God. 
- We all need people to tame us so that we cannot lose our place. We need to have a fear of accountability in order to have a consistent path. 
- People can easily miss God because they do not have any people they fear. We all need someone to guide us when we get off track.  
- We need to learn to have a quiet time with God and isolate ourselves from this world.
