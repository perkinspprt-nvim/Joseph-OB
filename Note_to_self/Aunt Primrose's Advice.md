Today (12/11/23), I met aunt Primrose and she talked to me about a lot of things. I am going to change myself with my new clear vision of today. 

I need to find my purpose. God is the giver of purpose. 

It is okay to not know what I want to do.

*Some stuff I need to clarify ?*
- [ ] How to make friends right
- [ ] How to stay on track
- [ ] How to not fail

##### It's not all about big colleges.  
- It is not all about waterloo and other Big companies.
- Common Application - US
  
##### What Do I want to do ? 
- I want to make education not such a rich man's option. 

##### How can I work towards what I want to be 
- I need to change, I need to advance Myself towards my goals.


#### Checking out universities. 
- What do they teach.
- How many Apply (Probably some big numbers. )
- How many are international (African, Asian, ETC ?)
- How many are accepted ( acceptance rate % )
- University Experience ( How does it feel like to study there ?)
- Money ? (How does the money fare there. )
- Others
